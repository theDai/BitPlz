# About

BitPlz is an Open Source application for online file sharing
through a web interface.

It is licensed under GPLv3. You should recieve a copy of the
license with this package.

It aims at people who have access to a online server for
hosting their own files. For example:

* Workgroups who need to share files and keep them private
* People who want to have no limits on how many or how big
  their shared files are
* People that want to have full control over who and when
  they share their files with.

BitPlz runs on top of the Pluf Framework [http://www.pluf.org].
See the INSTALL file for more information.

# Features / Roadmap

This feature set hopes to cover what we want to achieve with
this application, hopefully in that order, but it probably
will not reflect what and when these features are implemented.

Feedback is always welcome and the project will try to reflect
what people need of the appication.

Any way, here we go:

## Functionality

* User Management. **Very simple**, just enough for having more than one user on the system.
* Users can register openly.
* Upload and share publicly files over a browser
* View files uploaded by a user
* File Tagging
* File Type Filtering
* Control if files are public or private
* Control if private files can be viewed with password
* Control if private files can be viewed by specific users in the system
* File-lists
* Control if file-lists are public or private
* Control if private file-lists can be viewed with a password (file-list permissions override those of the file)
* Control if private file-lists can be viewed by specific users in the system (file-list permissions override those of the file)

## Admin Side

* Control if user registering is allowed (Open System)
* Control File Types allowed
* Control User Quota
